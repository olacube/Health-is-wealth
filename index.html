 <p><h2><strong><center>5 major causes of tiredness and Remeady</center</strong></h2></p><br/>
<h4>There are many reasons for tiredness, including a lack of sleep, poor diet, 
a sedentary lifestyle, stress, and medical conditions. According to the Centers
 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 15.3 percent of women and 
 10.1 percent of men regularly feel very tired or exhausted in the United States.<br/><br/> 
 </h4>
 <p><h3>Poor diet</h3></p>
<h4><p>The easiest way to banish tiredness is to make adjustments to your diet. Eating a healthful and balanced diet can make the world of difference to how you feel.
selection of healthy foods
Eating a healthful and balanced diet can help to combat fatigue. such as:</p>
<Ul>
<li>Fill half of your plate with fruits and vegetables</li>
<li>Eat the right amount of calories for your sex, age, weight, and activity level. </li>
<li>Lower your sugar intake: By avoiding food with high sugar content</li>
<li>Ensure whole grains make up half the grains you consume</li>
<li>Eat at regular intervals</li>
<li>Vary your protein routine &nbsp Try to choose lean poultry and meat, limit processed meats, choose unsalted nuts and seeds, and select some omega-3-rich seafood.</li>
</ul></h4>
<br/>

<p><h3>Lack of sleep</h3></p>
<p><h4>A lack of sleep may seem an obvious reason for feeling tired</h4></p>

<h4>Remeadies
<ul>
    <li><strong><b>Maintain a consistent sleep routine:</strong></b> &nbsp  Try to go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time each morning — even on the weekends.</li><br/>

    <li><strong><b>Avoid naps: </strong></b> &nbsp  We need a certain amount of sleep within a 24-hour period and no more than that. Napping reduces the amount of sleep that we require the following night, which might lead to difficulty getting to sleep and fragmented sleep.</li><br/>

    <li><strong><b>Limit time awake in bed to 5–10 minutes: </strong></b> &nbsp  If you find that you are lying awake in bed worrying or with your mind racing, get out of bed and sit in the dark until you are feeling sleepy, then go back to bed.</li><br/>

    <li><strong><b>Ensure that your bedroom is quiet, dark, and a comfortable temperature:  </strong></b> &nbsp Any light that enters your room could disturb your sleep. Ensure that your room is dark and that light emitted from digital devices is out of sight. Cooler room temperatures are considered better to promote sleep than warmer temperatures.</li><br>

    <li><strong><b>Limit caffeinated drinks: </strong></b> &nbsp  Try not to consume caffeinated beverages after noon. The stimulating effects of caffeine can last for many hours after intake and cause issues with initiating sleep.</li><br/>

    <li><strong><b>Avoid tobacco and alcohol before bed: </strong></b> &nbsp Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol before going to bed may cause fragmented sleep.</li>
</ul></h4>
</p><br/><br/>

 <p><h3>Excessive stress</h3></p>
<h4>Many situations can cause stress. such as exercise, work and many more. &nbsp
A little stress can be healthy and may actually make us more alert and able to perform better in tasks such as interviews, but stress is only a positive thing if it is short-lived.
Excessive, prolonged stress can cause physical and emotional exhaustion and lead to illness.
Stress makes your body generate more of the "fight-or-flight" chemicals that are designed to prepare your body for an emergency. <br/>
Remeady &nbsp
Avoid excess work</h4>
<br/><br/> 

<p><h3>Medical conditions</h3></p>

<h4><p>If you have made lifestyle changes to do with your physical activity, diet, stress levels, and sleep but still feel tired all the time, there could be an underlying medical condition. </p>
 Some of the most common conditions that report fatigue as a key symptom include:
 <ul>
   <li> anemia</li>
    <li>underactive thyroid</li>
    <li>diabetes</li>
    <li>anxiety</li>
    <li>depression</li>
    <li>chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
    <li>urinary tract infection</li>
    <li>food intolerance</li>
    <li>heart disease</li>
    <li>glandular fever</li>
    <li>pregnancy</li>
    <li>vitamin and mineral deficiencies</li>
</ul></h4><br/>

 <p><h3>Anxiety</h3></p>

<h4>Feeling anxious is sometimes perfectly normal. But some people have constant uncontrollable feelings of anxiety that are so strong they affect their daily life. 
<br/><br/>
Most importantly, ensure you always drink clean and pure water (i.e. avoid contaminated water).
